The entire dashboard is interactive and the visualizations inside it are all interconnected. 

In order to manipulate all graphs in one go, please click on an arc of the donut chart.

The multi-bar, multi-line, and the scatter plot of pie charts are all equipped with tooltips for greater insights.

The multi-bar chart comes with a drop-down menu for user to select their own age groups and manipulate the visualization as they please.

The radar and the steam graphs come with checkboxes to allow the user to select and de-select any attributes they choose.

Each visualization comes with its own set interaction, try hovering over the graphs, to find more about each one.
